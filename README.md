## Project Overview
This project aims to recommend Amazon products to users based on the Amazon product co-purchasing network. The goal is to design and develop a recommender system that is both accurate and efficient. The project involves conducting network analysis, sentiment analysis on product reviews, and implementing topic modeling to understand user preferences better. Finally, a machine learning-based recommendation system is developed to enhance product recommendations.

### Problem Statement
The problem this project addresses is the challenge of designing and developing a product recommendation system that is both accurate and efficient. By analyzing Amazon's co-purchasing network and user reviews, the project seeks to improve the accuracy of product recommendations, thereby enhancing the user experience and increasing sales on e-commerce platforms.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
- Amazon product co-purchasing network metadata was collected from the SNAP website.
- Amazon review data was collected from the Computer Science department of UCSD.

### Data Pre-processing
- Parsing and cleaning the data to remove unnecessary elements like spaces, punctuation, and stopwords.
- Tokenization of reviews for sentiment analysis.

### Network Analysis
- Generation of node and edge lists for network analysis.
- Calculation of degree centrality, average degree, and network density.

### Topic Modeling
- Implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify hidden topics in product reviews.
- Visualization of topics using pyLDAvis.

### Sentiment Analysis
- Sentiment analysis on product reviews using VADER, an NLTK module.
- Analysis of the sentiment distribution and frequent words in reviews.

### Product Recommendation
- Development of a recommendation system using machine learning-based collaborative filtering.
- Evaluation of the recommendation system using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Experiment
- Detailed evaluation of the datasets using the methods mentioned above.
- Sentiment analysis of music and video product reviews.
- Implementation and tuning of a product recommendation system.

## Limitations
- The system's performance is limited by hardware constraints and the size of the dataset.
- The datasets used are not up-to-date.
- Difficulty in handling stopwords specific to music and video products during sentiment analysis.

## Future Work
- Exploration of deep learning techniques for product recommendation.
- Continuous improvement of the model by incorporating new data.

## Conclusion
This project successfully implemented an accurate product recommendation system by leveraging network analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. The results provide valuable insights into user preferences and enhance the overall user experience on e-commerce platforms like Amazon.
